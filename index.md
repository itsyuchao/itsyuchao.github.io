## Bio

- I'm currently a **Doctor of Physical Therapy candidate** (graduating Jan 2024) at the [MGH Institute](https://www.mghihp.edu). While here, I have been a research assistant working with Dr. Teresa Jacobson Kimberley on various TMS and fMRI projects on focal dystonia and E-field modeling.
- Previously, I worked full-time as a **research specialist** at [Penn Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/lcns/) studying aphasia recovery and TMS in stroke and Alzheimer's disease. My supervisors were Drs. H. Branch Coslett and Roy H. Hamilton.  
- Before that, I graduated *summa cum laude* with a **B.A. in Cognitive Science** from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/). This is also where my science journey started.
  - My undergraduate thesis explored the neural correlates of beauty in literary stories ([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02926-0)). I was advised by Drs. Franziska Hartung and Anjan Chatterjee at [Penn Center for Neuroaesthetics](https://neuroaesthetics.med.upenn.edu/).
  - My summer research investigated how beauty in peacock feathers may be a form of camouflage ([link](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210924)). I was advised by Dr. Suzanne Amador Kane in [Haverford Biophysics Lab](https://www.haverford.edu/users/samador).

## Updates

* 7/22/23 My poster made it to OHBM2023! This was a DTI case study that followed up on a behavioral study I did in 2020 - wonderful to explore the brain-behavior correlations of TMS effects. 

* 2/21/23 Our pilot TMS/modeling project on brain shift with position change received great feedback during the mini-symposium at [5th International Brain Stimulatiion Conference](https://www.elsevier.com/events/conferences/international-brain-stimulation-conference/about)! Unfortunately I couldn't make it to Portugal in person.

* 8/20/22 Finished my first full-time clinical on Stroke/Neurology floor at the [Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital](https://spauldingrehab.org/locations/spaulding-rehabilitation-hospital). It was such a rich learning experience and couldn't be happier with my growth as a future clinician!

* 8/19/22 I presented a pilot study on TMS coil comparison at the [Brain & Human Body Modeling Conference](https://tmslab.martinos.org/conferences/brain-and-human-body-modeling-conference-2022/), among 57 other talks from 10 countries! Learned a ton from other researchers, and met potential collaborators:)

* 12/16/21 My undergraduate thesis studying beauty in stories is published on [*Communications Biology*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02926-0)!

* 8/4/21 First semester of DPT done:) I have also joined the [Brain Recovery Lab](https://www.mghihp.edu/BRL) to learn and conduct exciting research on dystonia!

* 4/30/21 I finished my work at Penn and will be pursuing a DPT at MGH Institute of Health Professions in June! Now time for a lot of packing and moving... And a trip to California:)
