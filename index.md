## Hi!

<p>         
I will be updating both academic and non-academic work/things that just interest me here. See the links for more. Thanks!
</p>

**Short bio:** Yuchao Wang is an incoming DPT student at the MGH Institute. He previously worked as a research specialist at [LCNS](https://www.med.upenn.edu/lcns/) investigating how brain stimulation may help with rehabilitation, especially in language functions. Before that, he studied beauty in the most general sense. For example, beautiful peacock feathers in nature may be camouflage rather than a handicap, due to [differences in animal visual systems](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210924). Beautifully-written stories, on the other hand, may allow us to learn more about brain network functions (see abstract [here](https://www.cogneurosociety.org/data-blitz-session-schedule/)). In his spare time, he enjoys Bach on Youtube and animals on Instagram.


## Updates

<p>
