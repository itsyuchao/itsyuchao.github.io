## Hi!


<p>         
I will be updating both academic and non-academic work/things that just interest me here. See the links for more. Thanks!

**Short bio:** Yuchao Wang currently works as a research specialist at [LCNS](https://www.med.upenn.edu/lcns/) investigating how brain stimulation may help with rehabilitation, especially in language functions. He previously studied beauty in the most general sense. Beautiful peacock feathers in nature may be camouflage rather than a handicap, due to [differences in animal visual systems](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210924). Beautifully-written stories, on the other hand, may allow us to learn more about brain network functions (see abstract [here](https://www.cogneurosociety.org/data-blitz-session-schedule/)). In his spare time, he enjoys Bach on Youtube and puppies on Instagram.
