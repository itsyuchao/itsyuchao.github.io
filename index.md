## Hi!


<p>         
I will be updating both academic and non-academic work/things that just interest me here. See the links for more. Thanks!

**Short bio:** Yuchao Wang is pursuing his B.A. in cognitive science at Haverford College. He currently conducts thesis research in [ChatLab](http://ccn.upenn.edu/chatterjee/) on how the brain responds to literariness in stories. Before this exciting journey in neuroaesthetics, he has researched on how predators actually perceive peacock feathers, and [the results](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210924) were probably not what Darwin had in mind. In his free time, he enjoys Bach on Youtube and puppies on Instagram.
