## Hi!

<p>         
I will be updating both academic and non-academic work/things that just interest me here. See the links for more. Thanks!
</p>

**Short bio:** Yuchao Wang is an incoming DPT student at the [MGH Institute](https://www.mghihp.edu). His goal is to work at the intersection of neuroscience research and physical therapy, and to use many of the computer vision and neural stimulation tools to analyze movements and create more effective treatments for pain, neurological and muscular dysfunctions. He previously worked as a research specialist at the [LCNS](https://www.med.upenn.edu/lcns/) investigating how TMS may help with rehabilitation, especially in people with aphasia. Before that, he studied beauty in the most general sense. For example, beautiful peacock feathers in nature may be camouflage rather than a handicap, due to [differences in animal visual systems](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210924). Beautifully-written stories, on the other hand, may allow us to learn more about [brain network functions](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tuwmz). In his spare time, he enjoys Bach on Youtube and on his guitar.


## Updates
