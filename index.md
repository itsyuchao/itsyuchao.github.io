## Hi!

I will be updating both academic and non-academic work/things that just interest me here. See the links for more. Thanks!

**Short bio:** Yuchao Wang is currently a DPT student at the [MGH Institute](https://www.mghihp.edu). His goal is to work at the intersection of neuroscience research and physical therapy, and to use many of the [computer vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08050) and [neural stimulation](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.022279) tools to analyze movements and create more effective treatments for pain, neurological and muscular dysfunctions. He previously worked as a research specialist at [Penn Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/lcns/) investigating how [TMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UKqY-sC7qQ) may help with rehabilitation, especially in people with aphasia. Before that, he studied *beauty* in the most general sense. For example, beautiful peacock feathers in nature may be camouflage rather than a handicap, due to [differences in animal visual systems](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210924). Beautifully-written stories, on the other hand, may allow us to learn more about [brain network functions](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tuwmz). Yuchao graduated *summa cum laude* with a B.A. in Cognitive Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/). In his spare time, he enjoys Bach on Youtube and on his guitar. He also has a cat, Doudou.

## Updates

* 8/4/21 First semester of DPT done! I have also joined the [Brain Recovery Lab](https://www.mghihp.edu/BRL) to learn and conduct exciting new research!

* 4/30/21 I finished my work at Penn and will be pursuing a DPT at MGH Institute of Health Professions in June! Now time for a lot of packing and moving... And a trip to California:)
