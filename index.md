## Bio

- In my first year as a **PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience** at [Duke](https://dibs.duke.edu/education/graduate/cognitive-neuroscience-admitting-program/). 
- I trained clinically as a **Doctor of Physical Therapy** at [MGH Institute](https://www.mghihp.edu). While there, I was a research assistant/fellow working with Dr. Teresa J. Kimberley on various TMS and fMRI projects on focal dystonia and E-field modeling.
- Previously, I worked as a research specialist at [Penn Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/lcns/) studying aphasia recovery and TMS in stroke and Alzheimer's disease. My supervisors were Drs. H. Branch Coslett and Roy H. Hamilton.  
- Before that, I graduated *summa cum laude* with a **B.A. in Cognitive Science** from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/). This is also where my science journey started.
  - My undergraduate thesis explored the neural correlates of beauty in literary stories ([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02926-0)). I was advised by Drs. Franziska Hartung and Anjan Chatterjee at [Penn Center for Neuroaesthetics](https://neuroaesthetics.med.upenn.edu/).
  - My summer research investigated how beauty in peacock feathers may be a form of camouflage ([link](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210924)). I was advised by Dr. Suzanne Amador Kane in [Haverford Biophysics Lab](https://www.haverford.edu/users/samador).
